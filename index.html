<p><b>When i was a child, i used to understand that love is blind, is it true? of course i was child 
but i realised that love is not blind, eyes are just having that kind of problem,for sure heart doesn't think, only 
brain does! love is a such perfect thing but in unreable way is such a fake thing.life is always 
a topic of many lessons, study and study hard pray but not jokes or playing in praying!!!</b></P>
